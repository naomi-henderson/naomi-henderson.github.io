### *2019.09.01* -  OCP CMIP6 Repository (netcdf)
- Haibo Liu continues to collect CMIP6 data for our OCP projects on the machines mary (for 'Amon') and june (for '6hrLev' and '3hr')
- Whatever he collects, the division is free to use on the guest Jupyter notebook on mary (https://mary.ldeo.columbia.edu:8000). Login as guest and then ask Haibo for the password if you have forgotten it. Those working with Haibo directly will have their own accounts on mary and june.
- We continue to develop more catalog/data access methods - `ingrid` and `python` are both supported and the hyrax `opendap` server allows us to pull the netcdf files into `matlab`, etc.  
- The mary and june homepages give many hints on how to access the data. Send a quick email to Haibo or me if you need the URL of their homepages
