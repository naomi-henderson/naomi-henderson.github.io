### *2019.11.01* -  Pangeo CMIP6 Google Cloud Repository (zarr)

#### Many thanks to Ryan Abernathey and the Pangeo Group for making this possible! 
	- The data collection is growing rapidly - thanks to Richard Seager for providing the local machinery
	- [Here](pages/tutorial1.html) is a quick tutorial for getting started


### *2019.10.18* - Hackathon Pages
	 - [Hackathon Projects](https://discourse.pangeo.io/c/cmip6hack/cmip6hack-projects)
	 - [Pangeo Gitter](https://gitter.im/pangeo-data/data)
	 - [Hackathon Agenda](https://cmip6hack.github.io/#/schedule)
	 - [NCAR CMIP6 Hackathon](https://cmip6hack.github.io/#/)


### *2019.09.28* - CMIP6 Cloud Data Request for Hackathon
	- [Make Request Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFjA5IddqBs2Rc0xGbzn32NPq12TKr-b-8KGtXWyNDK5sJCg/viewform)


### *2019.09.01* -  OCP CMIP6 Repository (netcdf)
	- Haibo Liu continues to collect CMIP6 data for our OCP projects on the machines mary (for 'Amon') and june (for '6hrLev' and '3hr')
	- Whatever he collects, the division is free to use on the guest Jupyter notebook on mary (https://mary.ldeo.columbia.edu:8000). Login as guest and then ask Haibo for the password if you have forgotten it. Those working with Haibo directly will have their own accounts on mary and june.
	- We continue to develop more catalog/data access methods - `ingrid` and `python` are both supported and the hyrax `opendap` server allows us to pull the netcdf files into `matlab`, etc.  
	- The mary and june homepages give many hints on how to access the data. Send a quick email to Haibo or me if you need the URL of their homepages.

[Markdown 1.0.1][dl] (18 KB) -- 17 Dec 2004

[dl]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/downloads/Markdown_1.0.1.zip


Introduction
------------

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Thus, "Markdown" is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax;
and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text
formatting to HTML. See the [Syntax][] page for details pertaining to
Markdown's formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the
online [Dingus][].
