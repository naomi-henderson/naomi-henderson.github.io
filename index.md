Once you click on this button, you can either log in with your Columbia UNI (this is easiest) but you can also sign in with your ORCID (go [here](https://orcid.org/register) to register), see the lower right hand side of the screen.

- Choose one of the sizes (doesn't really matter which)

- Download some short tutorials either in a notebook or terminal:

``` 
wget http://haden.ldeo.columbia.edu/notebooks/tutorial-Intake.ipynb
wget http://haden.ldeo.columbia.edu/notebooks/tutorial-noIntake.ipynb
```

- Start working through either tutorial.


- When you are finished, go to >File >Hub Control Panel >Stop My Server >Logout (upper righthand corner)
